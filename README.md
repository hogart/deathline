# deathline

Deathline is Telegram bot seed to create Lifeline-like games, written in TypeScript. Games are authored in JSON format. 
It's still in very early stages, but should work.

## Features

1) **Multimedia and rich messages** Cue can have embedded image or audio. You can also use Telegram subset of HTML/Markdown for formatting
1) **Delayed cues** Game can show response after predefined delay, in seconds or in human-readable format (`'15min'` or `'0.5h'`)
1) **Auto-transition** Game can show next cue automatically (with given delay to avoid bombarding user with info)
1) **Stateful game** Game has variables which can be set and changed by `setter` property
1) **Templating** Each message goes through `_.template` using current game state
1) **Conditional transitions** Choice can be hidden or shown depending on game state
1) **CSV importer** Author or draft game in any spreadsheet app, export as CSV and convert to deathline format
1) **Game file validation** Game is validated (for well-formedness) on loading using JSON schema

### Roadmap

- [ ] Extended game correctness validation
- [ ] Cues inheritance
- [ ] Procedural generation integration (Improv and/or Tracery)
- [ ] User input
- [ ] HTML5 minigames

## üï∏Ô∏è Requirements

- Node.js >= 8.x with npm

## üöÄ Running

* Clone project or download project
* Run `npm install` in project dir
* Get bot token from [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather)
* Create file named `.env` containing `BOT_TOKEN = <place your token here (no angle brackets)>`
* Run `npm start`

## üéÆ Creating games

Test game is located in `games/test_game.json`, it shows examples of game state, templating, markup and conditional transitions. Also take a look at `lib/deathline.ts`, it contains interfaces and types for game.

Place your game at `games/your_game.json` and run it by adding `GAME_NAME = your_game` to `.env` file.

There's no documentation at the moment, but you can take a look at `./schema.json`.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Contributing

Feature requests and bug reports are welcome, as well as sample games. 
As for code, please make sure your code follows `.editorconfig`, passes `npm run lint` (`npm run lint:fix` if needed) and is compiling. Tests are appreciated. Also be nice:)
