# deathline

Deathline is TG bot seed to create Lifeline-like games, written in TypeScript. Games are described in JSON format. 
It's still in very early stages, but should work.

## üï∏Ô∏è Requirements

- Node.js >= 8.x with npm

## üöÄ Running

* Clone project or download project
* Run `npm install` in project dir
* Get bot token from [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather)
* Create file named `.env` containing `BOT_TOKEN = <place your token here (no angle brackets)>`
* Run `npm start`

## üéÆ Creating games

Test game is located in `games/pushkin.json` (Russian only at the moment). Also take a look at `lib/deathline.ts`, it contains interfaces and types for game.

Place your game at `games/your_game.json` and run it by adding `GAME_NAME = your_game` to `.env` file.

There's no documentation at the moment, but you can take a look at `./schema.json`.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Contributing

Feature requests and bug reports are welcome, as well as sample games. 
As for code, please make sure your code follows `.editorconfig`, passes `npm run lint` (`npm run lint:fix` if needed) and is compiling. Also be nice:)
